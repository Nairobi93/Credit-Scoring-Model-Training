# Credit-Scoring-Model-Training

## Objective

- Create a credit scoring algorithm that predicts the chance of a given loan applicant defaulting on loan repayment.

- What are the different factors which affect the target variable? What business recommendations can we give based on the analysis?

- How can we improve model performance using hyperparameter tuning and prevent data leakage using pipelines while building a model to predict the response of a customer?

- Data processing & EDA (Missing data analysis and treatment, Outlier treatment , 

- Base model
- 
- Feature Selection & experimentation (Multicollinearity - VIF & Correlation matrix )


- Parameter tuning


- Misclassification analysis

- Sub population analysis

- Loss rate analysis

- Productionization
